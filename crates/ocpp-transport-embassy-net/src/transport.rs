//! OCPP-over-WebSocket transport over an `embassy_net::Stack`, with optional TLS (`wss://`).
//!
//! Uses `embedded-websocket`'s sans-io `WebSocket` core (not its `framer_async` module) driven
//! directly over `embassy_net::tcp::{TcpReader, TcpWriter}` - see this crate's README for why,
//! and for the buffering/fragmentation/close-handshake simplifications made here that haven't
//! been validated against a real CSMS yet.
//!
//! When [`ConnectConfig::tls`] is set the TCP socket is wrapped in an `embedded-tls`
//! [`TlsConnection`] *before* the WebSocket handshake, giving `wss://` with the same
//! sans-io WebSocket layer. See [`TlsConfig`]/[`TlsVerify`] for the certificate-verification
//! options and their limitations.

//
// Every (re)connect needs ~4 KiB of TCP buffers and, on `wss://`, ~19 KiB
// more of TLS record buffers. `TcpSocket`/`TlsConnection` demand `&'static`
// slices, so the straightforward implementation `Box::leak`s them per
// attempt — which not only grows the heap forever but, worse, leaks the
// socket itself: `TcpSocket`'s `Drop` is what removes it from the stack's
// `SocketSet`, so a leaked socket holds its slot forever and a few failed
// attempts make `TcpSocket::new` panic on a full set.
//
// Instead, connect-attempt buffers are leased from [`BUF_POOL`]: a global
// freelist of `Box<[u8]>`es. While leased, a buffer is handed to the
// socket/TLS layer as a `&'static mut` slice; when the owning guard drops —
// i.e. when the last reader/writer half referencing that connection is
// dropped — the buffer returns to the pool for the next attempt. The heap
// cost of reconnecting is therefore bounded by the number of *concurrently
// alive* connections, not by the number of attempts.
